</ol>
<h3>4. Interacting with Decentralized Applications (dApps)</h3>
<p>MetaMask enables users to interact with various dApps across the Ethereum network and other compatible blockchains.</p>

<li><strong>Avoid Digital Storage:</strong> Do not store your recovery phrase digitally (e.g., in a text file or cloud storage) to reduce the risk of hacking.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4>
